# Additional context for query generation and documentation responses
# Add information that helps generate better queries and documentation responses
# For example:
# - Authentication requirements (e.g., "All queries require Bearer token")
# - Common query patterns (e.g., "Queries should include pagination parameters")
# - Rate limiting details (e.g., "Max 100 requests per minute")
# - Required headers (e.g., "Content-Type must be application/json")
# - Response formats (e.g., "All responses are in JSON format")
# - Error handling (e.g., "Include error handling for 429 rate limit responses")

# Remove these example comments and add your query metadata here
