The Tally API is a GraphQL API that provides access to on-chain governance data across multiple blockchain networks. It is designed primarily for developers building decentralized applications (dApps) and tools related to decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and on-chain voting. The API allows querying governance-related data such as proposals, votes, delegates, tokens, and organizations. It enables developers to create data-driven experiences connected to real-time on-chain governance activity.
